### CNC Machine

In today's class, we learned about the CNC (computer numerical control) which plays a huge role in most machineries we use both in the lab and in real world applications. In general, CNC is used in machines such as 3D printers and CNC milling machines, but we only refer to it as the latter. We learnt that CNC machines work in 3 axis, just like 3D printers, but some complicated CNC machines work in even more than that, by accommodating rotations, which is necessary for smooth milling.

We learned about composites, and how we can manipulate the physical properties of a composite by changing the internal structure (such as by adding layers or having a core).

Finally, we tried to make a composite using the CNC machine. To do so, we prepared an STL file with Fusion 360, and then we set up the CNC machine, and changed the tool paths and other settings to make the mold as smooth as possible. After running the machine, we prepare the layers of the composite which consists of:

1. Release layer
2. Epoxy layer
3. Bleeder layer
4. Breather layer
5. Release layer

### Assignment

For our assignment, my partner (Karen) and I chose to create a composite of a 3D map of Earth. We prepared the STL file, and then we set up the CNC machine, and ran a mill. Our mold is made of foam.The first print worked, but it could have been improved, so we ran another print but with more tool paths and different angle of milling, which increased the smoothness of our mold.

We then begun preparing the composite. We did that by using a specific ratio of epoxy and placing layers of composite and breather and bleeder layers, then we waited overnight for the composite to dry.

The composite had a very stable structure, and it was detailed enough to be recognizable.
