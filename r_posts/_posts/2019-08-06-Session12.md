### Idea

For my final project, I decided to follow my passion for music in a way I never have done before. My goal is to build a robot that plays the piano. The song that I chose is "Ode to Joy" by Beethoven. Initially, I have decided to use servos for my project to press the piano keys. The robot will be tested in the Harvard Music Department.

### Week 3

I connected 5 servo motors to the Arduino, and programmed the motors to imitate finger movement for the musical piece "Ode to Joy". Each servo was set to a note, and the angle of each servo is set according to the timing of the notes. So far, the Arduino plays the entire song through. The next part is to build a base for the servo motors to be placed on, and then to build and attach parts to the servos in order to push the piano keys.

### Week 5

I had several issues with the servos, as although they functioned consistently, placing them on the base was troubling, as I found that the maximum distance between the piano keys were 2 cm, while the minimum distance between the servos were beyond this threshold. I then found a suitable alternative to the servos; a solenoid. The mechanical motion of the solenoid is quite similar to that of a finger, and the solenoids could be easily fit onto a base.

The following is the initial code planned for the servos.

The solenoids required power higher than what the Arduino supplies, and for that I used the vIn pin and connected a 12v power supply to the Arduino. I then connected the 12v source to MOSFET transistors and programmed transistors to open and close the gates of the transistor according to the song, and then connected the transistor to the solenoid.

I then drilled holes onto the wood base, and screwed the solenoids on it. Then, I soldered wires to the solenoids, and use the laser cutter to create the sides of the robot. I had trouble with the laser cutter, as I created two holes to plug in the computer or the power supply which were too small to fit. I then laser cut another side with larger holes which fit well on the Arduino.

The following is the code for the solenoids.

```void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
pinMode(6, OUTPUT);
}
