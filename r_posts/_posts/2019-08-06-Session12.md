### Idea

For my final project, I decided to follow my passion for music in a way I never have done before. My goal is to build a robot that plays the piano. The song that I chose is "Ode to Joy" by Beethoven. Initially, I have decided to use servos for my project to press the piano keys. The robot will be tested in the Harvard Music Department.

### Week 3

I connected 5 servo motors to the Arduino, and programmed the motors to imitate finger movement for the musical piece "Ode to Joy". Each servo was set to a note, and the angle of each servo is set according to the timing of the notes. So far, the Arduino plays the entire song through. The next part is to build a base for the servo motors to be placed on, and then to build and attach parts to the servos in order to push the piano keys.

### Week 5

I had several issues with the servos, as although they functioned consistently, placing them on the base was troubling, as I found that the maximum distance between the piano keys were 2 cm, while the minimum distance between the servos were beyond this threshold. I then found a suitable alternative to the servos; a solenoid. The mechanical motion of the solenoid is quite similar to that of a finger, and the solenoids could be easily fit onto a base.

The following is the initial code planned for the servos.


```

#include <Servo.h>

Servo e;  // create servo object to control a servo
// twelve servo objects can be created on most boards
Servo f;
Servo g;
Servo d;
Servo c;
void setup() {
  e.attach(2);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
  f.attach(3);
  g.attach(4);
  d.attach(5);
  c.attach(6);
}

The solenoids required power higher than what the Arduino supplies, and for that I used the vIn pin and connected a 12v power supply to the Arduino. I then connected the 12v source to MOSFET transistors and programmed transistors to open and close the gates of the transistor according to the song, and then connected the transistor to the solenoid.

I then drilled holes onto the wood base, and screwed the solenoids on it. Then, I soldered wires to the solenoids, and use the laser cutter to create the sides of the robot. I had trouble with the laser cutter, as I created two holes to plug in the computer or the power supply which were too small to fit. I then laser cut another side with larger holes which fit well on the Arduino.

### Week 6   

I decided to make another prototype of the project using an Arduino micro on a smaller prototype board. However, it was very tedious, and there were many issues with the second prototype such as the solder tearing from the connections. The prototype was also too small and impractical for my solution.

<img src="e.jpg" alt="Board Traces"  width="90%">




<img src="f.jpg" alt="Board Traces"  width="90%">


I then used a FET circuit board and soldered the connections, but there were problems which caused it to short (due to overlapping wire connections). After rewiring the piano player to the prototype board, I checked if there was any problem and went to my second attempt with the circuit board, in which the ground pins were all connected together. This attempt was more successful, but some of the keys were still not working.

### Week 7

After modifying and debugging all the hardware issues with the FET board, I eventually managed to get all the keys to work. Now that the keys are working, I needed to build a base for the piano. After coming with multiple designs, I chose and 3D printed one which can hold the solenoids without shorting them. However, the CURA slicer had issues, so I decided to use the Prusa Slicer.

I decided to use an external variable power supply, and increased the voltage from the previously tested 12V to around 25V. This showed positive results as the solenoids were pushing down with greater force. However, this solution is impractical and any voltage greater than 25V can damage the transistors. Even with the 25V, the force exerted doesn't seem to be enough to push the piano keys, however, the motion of the keys is precise and in harmony.

<img src="j.jpg" alt="Board Traces"  width="90%">

I then 3D printed another version of the keys to improve stability as the previous version kept on separating from the solenoid. They keys were drilled onto the solenoid. I also 3D printed a base for the solenoids to prevent them from shorting.
