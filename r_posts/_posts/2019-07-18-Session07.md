### Sensors

In today's lecture, we were introduced to input devices (sensors) such as light, sound, and motion sensors. We learned about how micro controllers such as the Arduino interprets analog signals in methods such as voltage dividers (a good example of this is a potentiometer). There are many types of sensors, which include sound sensors such as piezoelectric sensors, which act as voltage dividers that depend on the detect vibrations. Light sensors include photoresistors and phototransistors. Phototransistors are transistors with the gate opening when light is detected. Photoresistors on the other hand are voltage dividers which changes the voltage depending on the brightness of the light it detects. Thermistor is a type of temperature sensor which produces a signal voltage depending on the temperature surrounding the thermistor.

We then built a circuit that does certain functions such as a touch sensor using capacitance. To do so, we cut two pieces of copper from a copper roll. We then taped the copper to wires which we hooked up to the Arduino. I built a touch sensor using the capacitance and got the results through the analog input and displayed it on the serial plotter. The voltage dropped whenever I touched the copper.

### Assignment

For today's assignment, I built a circuit using a phototransistor to detect light as an input and turn on an LED when no light is detected. Initially, I had trouble with the circuit as I didn't connect a resistor to the ground in parallel with the wire connected to the analog pin. After doing so, the circuit worked, as I have seen from the output (on the LED) and the serial plotter showed the results.


```///////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Project 5.01 Read the phototransistor
int photoTran = A1;
int reading = 0;
int sensorValue;
void setup(){
  pinMode(photoTran,INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(5,OUTPUT);

}     

void loop(){
  reading = (analogRead(photoTran)-660)*10;
  sensorValue = map(reading,0, 1023, 0, 10)+60;
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  if(sensorValue > 0){
digitalWrite(5,LOW);

  }else{
    digitalWrite(5,HIGH);
  }
  delay(100);

}
```
