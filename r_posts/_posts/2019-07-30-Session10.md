### Molding and Casting

In today's session, we were introduced to the concept of molding and casting. Casting is a really important process in fabrication, as it can be used to create multiple copies of the object. To cast an object, we first need a mold. we place our object in a cup (we can stick it using clay) and pouring mold material into it. The material is made of two mixtures in equal volumes. After waiting for the mixture to dry, we remove the object, and pour silicon (or plaster of Paris) into the mold, and after waiting for it to cure, we cut and tear the mold to reveal our cast.

### Sewing

In today's session we tried sewing with a Brother machine, in which we learnt to create our own actuator (which can be used for wearable technologies). First, we follow the instructions to use the machine which include setting up the fabric and the sewing patterns which best suit our goals.

### Assignment

For my assignment, I chose to make a cast of an object I 3D printed. I tried to 3D print an object (a thumbs up hand gesture), however, the printer had problems with the filament. After trying to troubleshoot, I decided to use a previously printed object, so I used a nut and bolt which I printed previously, as I tried to make two casts in one mold.

I started with using clay to stick both the nut and bolt to the bottom of the cup. The nut didn't stick to the bottom of the cup when adding the mold mixture.
