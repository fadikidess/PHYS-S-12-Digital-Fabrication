### 3D modeling

We started today's class with a review of 3D modeling using Fusion 360. We learned about how we can extrude sketches to create bodies, and creating components from the bodies to save them as STL files.

We then proceed to the Ultimaker CURA to process the STL files into gcode files, which can be read by the 3D printer. In CURA, we change settings such as performing transformations (in position, size, and rotation), choosing the percentage of fillings, and much more. When ready, CURA converts the STL file into gcode through the slicing process, which is then saved on an SD card to be taken to the printer.

### 3D printing

3D printers are used in a wide variety of applications in a multitude of different fields such as medicine, engineering, and much more. 3D printing is very useful in creating solutions that are too complicated to be created manually.

3D printers print objects by printing layers upon layers of filament. The 3D printers available to us are the "ORIGINAL PRUSA i3 MK3".

### Assignment

For our assignment, I designed a nut and a bolt. This was done by creating a cylindrical object on an octagonal base in Fusion 360 and applying threads. I then created another octagonal base with a hole the size of the diameter of the cylindrical object and applied threads to it. I then save both components to an STL file, then applied changes in Ultimaker CURA (such as decreasing the size of the model to reduce the printing time) and then begun the slicing process and saved the gcode file to an SD card.

Then, I started the printing process by preheating the printer, and calibrating the z-axis. Then, I opened the gcode file from the SD card and started printing.

On the first attempt to print the model, the file was incomplete as it was not directly saved onto the SD card. After doing so, the printer successfully printed the file.
