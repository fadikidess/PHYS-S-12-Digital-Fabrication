### Micro-Controllers

In today's class, we learned how to build simple prototypes with an Arduino such as blinking LEDs. I managed to build two prototypes with the Arduino that have different functionalities.

Arduino is an open source micro-controller. Micro-controllers are single-chip computers that carry out a variety of functions. These micro-controllers can be programmed to do certain applications such as doing a voltage reading, blinking LEDs, and running motors.

I first started with a circuit that measures the temperature and outputs the reading to the serial monitor. This was done by connecting the 5v pin and the Ground of the Arduino to the temperature sensor and connect the output voltage to the analog input at the pin A0 and reading the value, then printing it to the serial monitor every 250 milliseconds.


```
```int val = 0;
void setup(){
Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop(){
	val = analogRead(A0);
	Serial.print(val);
	delay(250);
}
```

The second circuit was a small car made using 4 motors connected to the Arduino. The positive terminal of the motors were connected to the digital pins, which were set to output at high voltage. However, issues were followed as initially the motors were connected to the digital pins 0 and 1 while uploading which caused an error as those pins are used as transmitter/receiver pins. The negative terminals were connected to the analog pins instead of the common ground which gave me control to switch the direction of the current, allowing me to reverse the motors by setting either the digital or analog pins to high or low. However, the voltage and current produced by the GPIO pins (General Purpose Input Output) were both too low to generate enough torque to cause motion.

The following is the code for the second circuit
```   
```int val = 0;
void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
pinMode(2,OUTPUT);
pinMode(3,OUTPUT);
pinMode(4,OUTPUT);
pinMode(5,OUTPUT);

pinMode(A0,OUTPUT);
pinMode(A1,OUTPUT);
pinMode(A2,OUTPUT);
pinMode(A3,OUTPUT);

}
void loop()
{   
  digitalWrite(2,HIGH);
  digitalWrite(3,HIGH);
  digitalWrite(4,HIGH);
  digitalWrite(5,HIGH);

  digitalWrite(A0,LOW);
  digitalWrite(A1,LOW);
  digitalWrite(A2,LOW);
  digitalWrite(A3,LOW);
  delay(2500);  
Serial.print(analogRead(A0));
    digitalWrite(2,LOW);
  digitalWrite(3,LOW);
  digitalWrite(4,LOW);
  digitalWrite(5,LOW);

  digitalWrite(A0,HIGH);
  digitalWrite(A1,HIGH);
  digitalWrite(A2,HIGH);
  digitalWrite(A3,HIGH);


}  



```

### Lab session:


## Multimeters

In todays's session, we used the circuits that we built in the last session and recorded observations using multimeters. This was done by connecting the input of the multimeter to the source of the Arduino (power supply pins or GPIO pins that are set to high).

We learned more about electronic parts in this session including transistors and resistors.

## Transistors

Transistors are devices that can be used to amplify or switch electronics and power sources. There are many types of transistors, but the one that I got to use is the N-type MOSFET transistor. MOSFET transistors have three terminals:

1. Gate (the switch of the circuit. Supplying the correct voltage results in closing the circuit)
2. Drain (the part of the circuit the gets power from the source to power the circuit, which is dependent on the voltage supplied to the gate)
3. Source (the source is the supply of power which is aimed to reach the drain in order to close the circuit)

## Resistors

Resistors are devices which creates electrical resistance by turning energy from the current to heat, thus either decreasing the voltage or the current, which is according to Ohm's law:

(Ohm's law. https://learn.digilentinc.com/Documents/Digital/BT01_02_ResistorOhmLaw/OhmTriangle.jpg)

Resistors have a color code in order to get the resistance of that resistor.

## Testing circuits

I then measured the voltage of particular parts of the circuit I was building in the last session. In fact, I discovered the reason why the motors did not generate enough torque to move the car. The voltage reading at the motors was less than 2V, which is much lower than needed. So I rewired the motors, and connected the source wire to 5V, and the car moved slowly (as 5V is still too low, but enough to move the car at some extent).

## Tools and Equipment

We used equipment that are essential in prototyping. Such equipment include drills, saws and much more.

We first used the saws. We learnt that saws work on either the push or the pull, depending on their purpose. We used a saw for wood too cut pieces from a wood stick.

We then cut metal rods using hack saws. Initially, it did not work as the blades had to be replaced. Then, we used a piece of plastic to drill on.

We wanted to glue the metal piece we cut into a hole in the piece of plastic to get an idea on how to use equipment such as the drill. To drill, we measured the diameter of the piece of metal through digital length measuring.

Then, we marked the point on which we will drill, and then we drilled on the piece of plastic. Then, we used glue to stick both pieces together.

## Augmented Reality Demo

Finally, we had a demo with an Augmented Reality program, which ran on the Microsoft HoloLens using Unity for the User Interface. The demo had holographic graphs that were connected to a breadboard, which was capable of multimeter readings on the breadboard.
