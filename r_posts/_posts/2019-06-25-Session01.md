### Introduction to digital fabrication

In today's class, we had an introduction to the class as well as we toured around the lab, looking at equipment and getting an idea of what the next few weeks will be like, and equipment will we use.

We talked briefly about some machinery such as vinyl cutters and 3D printers.

Our first assignment was to create a website for the purpose of documentation throughout the course.

We started the website in class as we learnt about Github, which is an open source platform for sharing ideas through programming. We used Github pages for our website and learnt how to commit changes to our files on our desk and uploading them by pushing origin.

### Lab Safety

We also discussed safety in this course as we learned about safety procedures and equipment including safety glasses.
