### Review of tools and procedures
 
In today's class, we begun with a review of tools such as saws and knives, as well as other methods of fabrication including drilling and joining.

Such methods facilitate the development of our prototype, as well as increasing our quality and productivity while doing so, as well as keeping safety procedures in consideration.


### Arduino review

Then, we learnt about the I/O (input/output) pins, as well as PWM (pulse width monitor) and Arduino programming.

There are two types of I/O pins, digital and analog pins. Digital pins are pins that provide a source of power to connections such as LEDs (only used for output). they are used for low energy applications such as LEDs, but for applications such as motors, digital pins are connected to the gate of a transistor, and an external power supply connected to the motor. Digital pins have pull-up resistors that act as a switch to connected components. Analog pins are pins that measure readings from connected sensors (only used for input). It works as an analog to digital converter returning values from readings from 0 to 1023. PWM can be found in Arduino boards in digital pins by looking for a "~" sign next to the pin number, or by looking for it in
