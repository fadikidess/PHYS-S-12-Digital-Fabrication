### Tools and Equipment

In today's class, we used equipment that are essential in prototyping. Such equipment include drills, saws and much more.

We first used the saws. We learnt that saws work on either the push or the pull, depending on their purpose. We used a saw for wood too cut pieces from a wood stick.

We then cut metal rods using hack saws. Initially, it did not work as the blades had to be replaced. Then, we used a piece of plastic to drill on.

We wanted to glue the metal piece we cut into a hole in the piece of plastic to get an idea on how to use equipment such as the drill. To drill, we measured the diameter of the piece of metal through digital length measuring.

Then, we marked the point on which we will drill, and then we drilled on the piece of plastic. Then, we used glue to stick both pieces together

### Augmented Reality Demo

Finally, we had a demo with an Augmented Reality program, which ran on the Microsoft HoloLens using Unity for the User Interface. The demo had holographic graphs that were connected to a breadboard, which was capable of multimeter readings on the breadboard
