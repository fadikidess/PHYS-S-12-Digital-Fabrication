### Multimeters

In todays's session, we used the circuits that we built in the last session and recorded observations using multimeters. This was done by connecting the input of the multimeter to the source of the Arduino (power supply pins or GPIO pins that are set to high).

We learned more about electronic parts in this session including transistors and resistors.

### Transistors

Transistors are devices that can be used to amplify or switch electronics and power sources. There are many types of transistors, but the one that I got to use is the N-type MOSFET transistor. MOSFET transistors have three terminals:

1. Gate (the switch of the circuit. Supplying the correct voltage results in closing the circuit)
2. Drain (the part of the circuit the gets power from the source to power the circuit, which is dependent on the voltage supplied to the gate)
3. Source (the source is the supply of power which is aimed to reach the drain in order to close the circuit)

### Resistors

Resistors are devices which creates electrical resistance by turning energy from the current to heat, thus either decreasing the voltage or the current, which is according to Ohm's law:

(Ohm's law)

Resistors have a color code in order to get the resistance of that resistor.

### Testing circuits

I then measured the voltage of particular parts of the circuit I was building in the last session. In fact, I discovered the reason why the motors did not generate enough torque to move the car. The voltage reading at the motors was less than 2V, which is much lower than needed. So I rewired the motors, and connected the source wire to 5V, and the car moved slowly (as 5V is still too low, but enough to move the car at some extent).
