### Fusion 360

Fusion 360 is a Computer-aided design (CAD) software which is utilized to create models to be built. Fusion 360 is used by many people and organizations to develop solutions with multitude levels of complexities. We started learning Fusion 360 to aid us with the construction of our next assignment, which is building a press-fit kit.

With Fusion 360, we learnt the basics of creating models and sketches of prototypes, as well as exporting them to DXF files in order to print them using the laser cutter.

Sketches are 2D designs and drawings that are created by drawing lines, squares, and other shapes on a 2D surface. Designs can be mirrored and altered. After the sketch is ready, we stop the sketch and start extruding the design on the z-axis to get a 3D product. When satisfied with the results, you can create a component version of it.

### Laser Cutter

The laser cutter is a machine which uses a beam of high intensity laser with an infrared wavelength that burns/melts materials that are within its proximity and directly under its focus. It is mostly used to cut pieces of cardboard, wood, and other material, as well as engraving shapes and drawings on surfaces by translating the g-code into a series of movements in the machine.

There are several procedures needed to be addressed before using the laser cutter. First, the ventilation system must be on. Then the cooling system is turned on. The machine is then turned on and the position of the laser is manually set. The sketch from Fusion 360 is then prepared (such as the speed and power of the laser), and then the machine cuts the material.



### Vinyl Cutter

The vinyl cutter is a machine that cuts vinyl into specific images and designs such as bitmap files (.bmp). Vinyl cutters can be used to create stickers and icons. Vinyl cutters use a blade that interprets g-code and moves accordingly.

### Lab

In today's lab session, we cut a piece of cardboard (using the laser cutter) into a sketch from Fusion 360 (which was our assignment). We started with editing our sketch, and when the changes were ready, we saved the sketch as a DXF file.

When we started the laser cutter by following procedure. First, we turned on the ventilation system, and then we turned on the cooling system and then the laser cutter is turned on. In the case of an emergency there is a red button that turns of the machine.

The piece I cut was a press-fit kit with a cavity in the center in order to attach other pieces.

### Final Project Progress

In another lab session, I added 5 servo motors to the Arduino, and programmed the motors to imitate finger movement for the musical piece "Ode to Joy". Each servo was set to a note, and the angle of each servo is set according to the timing of the notes. So far, the Arduino plays the entire song through. The next part is to build a base for the servo motors to be placed on, and then to build and attach parts to the servos in order to push the piano keys.
