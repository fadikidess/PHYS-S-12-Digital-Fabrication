### Arduino Programming

We reviewed the basics of Arduino programming (which is based on the programming language C), as we learnt about the different data types such as booleans, integers, and functions.

In doing so, we designed circuits and programmed them to do various functions such as looping the code using for loops.

We also used various other features such as AnalogWrite() and PWM to control voltage output for devices.

We also used hardware equipment such as transistors and sensors to receive inputs and send output (for example to an LED).

We learned about how to learn more about code through reading documentation. We tried several functions and tested it with the Arduino.

### Assignment

For our assignment, we had to build a circuit that would receive an input from an Arduino in the form of a push button, and output light from an LED.

Initially, I had trouble with the circuit as I tried with the Arduino Nano as the driver didn't install on my computer, and the Nano shorted and malfunctioned. I used the Arduino Uno from my final project for this assignment which worked.

I developed two programs for this assignment. One in which the LED turns on whenever the button is pressed, and turns off on button release.
