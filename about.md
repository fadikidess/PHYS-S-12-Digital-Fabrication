My name is Fadi Kidess, and I am really interested in developing prototypes for ideas  using both software and hardware (such as Arduino) as well as interfacing input with electronics. I am also determined to learn and use other skills including 3D printing and CNC milling to put together my final project.

As for my final project, so far I have chosen to build a robot that plays the piano. I will program it to play a specific song. It will be built using servo motors and will be tested to play a song. The reason I chose this project is that piano is one of my passions, and building this robot will help me think outside the box and visualize how I can connect my passions to create great and fun projects.

Parts list -so far:
1. Arduino
2. Servo motors
3. 3D-printed parts (such as fingers)

### Final Project Progress

In another lab session, I added 5 servo motors to the Arduino, and programmed the motors to imitate finger movement for the musical piece "Ode to Joy". Each servo was set to a note, and the angle of each servo is set according to the timing of the notes. So far, the Arduino plays the entire song through. The next part is to build a base for the servo motors to be placed on, and then to build and attach parts to the servos in order to push the piano keys.
