My name is Fadi Kidess, and I am really interested in developing prototypes for ideas  using both software and hardware (such as Arduino) as well as interfacing input with electronics. I am also determined to learn and use other skills including 3D printing and CNC milling to put together my final project.

As for my final project, so far I have chosen to build a robotic arm that is controlled by a person's arm movements through the use of EMG (electromyography) sensors and analyzing the data using the Arduino to be converted in to output commands controlling the robotic arm. The arm will have unique extensions such as copying motion from not only fingers and a hand, but also elbow motion to rotate the robotic arm on multiple axis using mechanical methods such as extension and contraction with balloon-like device.

Parts list -so far:
1. EMG sensors
2. Arduino
3. Servo motors
4. 3D-printed parts (such as fingers of the robotic arm)
